The "Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression" project is a Python-based predictive analytics model designed to forecast customer churn in the telecom sector.

Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression
Introduction
This project, "Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression," is developed by GOLTHI MADHU APPALA NARASIMHA as part of the CodeClause Internship on Data Science. The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can forecast customer churn in the telecom sector. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to proactively address customer retention and implement strategies to reduce customer attrition.
